# Zmeans

The goal of Zmeans is to implement the popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm [k-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) entirely in Zig.\ 
The project is then to further implement the methods and practices used in the paper [Less is More: Parameter-Free Text Classification with Gzip](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09410.pdf).\

## TODO

1. Understand the algorithm
2. Implement the algorithm
3. Read through the paper
4. Implement the paper
